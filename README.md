# Docker TTS with Piper üó£Ô∏è  

This project provides a simple, self-contained Docker solution to convert text files (`.txt`) and PDF files (`.pdf`) into speech (`.mp3`) using the high-quality, local **Piper TTS** engine. It is controlled by a simple shell script for easy use.  

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Versatile Input**: Converts both `.txt` and `.pdf` files.  
- **High-Quality Voice**: Uses the fast and natural-sounding Piper TTS engine.  
- **Containerized**: Fully containerized with Docker for easy setup and portability. The environment is consistent and works anywhere Docker is installed.  
- **Simple Usage**: A single, straightforward command-line script handles the entire process.  
- **MP3 Output**: Generates a standard `.mp3` audio file.  
- **Robust Error Handling**: The main script provides clear error messages if the conversion fails.

## üîß Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your host machine:

- **Docker Engine** ‚Üí [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)  
- **Docker Compose** ‚Üí [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)  
- **A bash-compatible shell** ‚Üí Standard on Linux and macOS.  
- **pdftotext** ‚Üí Required to extract text from PDF files. It is part of the `poppler-utils` package.  

### Install `poppler-utils`  
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install poppler-utils

# Fedora/CentOS
sudo dnf install poppler-utils

# macOS (with Homebrew)
brew install poppler
```

## üìÇ Project Structure
The repository contains the following key files:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml   # Defines and configures the Docker service.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile           # Builds the Docker image with Piper and dependencies.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ speak.sh             # Main script you run to convert files.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tts.sh               # Internal script inside the container for conversion.
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project. You only need to do this once.

### 1. Make the Script Executable  
```bash
chmod +x speak.sh
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image  
This command builds the Docker image, downloading the Piper engine and all its dependencies:  
```bash
docker compose build
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
To convert a file, use the `speak.sh` script. It takes two arguments: the input file and the desired output filename.

**Syntax**:
```bash
./speak.sh <input-file.pdf|txt> <output-file.mp3>
```

**Example (Converting a PDF)**:
```bash
./speak.sh my_document.pdf my_audiobook.mp3
```

**Example (Converting a Text File)**:
```bash
./speak.sh my_notes.txt my_notes_audio.mp3
```

The script will process the file and save the resulting audio to the output path you specified.

## üé§ Customization: Changing the Voice
You can easily change the voice model by modifying the `Dockerfile`.

1. **Find a New Voice**  
   Browse the [Piper Voice Library on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/tree/main).  

2. **Get the Download Links**  
   Navigate to the voice you want (e.g., `en_GB/vctk/medium`).  
   Copy the link addresses for both the `.onnx` and `.onnx.json` files.  

3. **Edit the Dockerfile**  
   Open the `Dockerfile` and find the section for downloading the voice model (Step #5).  
   Replace the two `wget` URLs with the new links.  

4. **Rebuild the Image**  
   Save the `Dockerfile` and run:  
   ```bash
   docker compose build
   ```
   All subsequent conversions will now use the new voice.
